# Funky Monkey

A small passion project made by RooRay with the help of others to showcase my learning of Discord.JS and using GitHub!

# Hosting

This bot natively supports being hosted on either Replit or Railway, it may work on others but hasn't been tested. Rough guide below:

Use your respective platforms' environment variables feature, set the variable name to `token` and the value to your [Discord bots token](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#setting-up-a-bot-application).

If the option to use environment variables is not available (such as if you're using a traditional NodeJS Discord bot host), create a `.env` file and type `token=` followed by your Discord bots token and save the file, you may need to download the [NPM library `dotenv` for this to work](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).
