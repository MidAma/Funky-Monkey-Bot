# Security

I don't expect this project to have many security issues in it but if you find anything or are just curious, what you need to know is below.

## Versions Receiving Security Updates

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest Development Build   | :white_check_mark: |
| All Other Development Builds  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, email me at `main@rooray.xyz` with the issue that you have found. I'll reply as fast as my can and implement a fix ASAP (usually a few days maximum).

In turn for your vulnerability report you'll be added in the credits in both the README and the bot's "build" command.
